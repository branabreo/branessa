				Dear Vanessa,
				<br><br>


  				As requested, I'm writing a letter to describe you from a third person perspective. 
  				<br><br>
					Gosh this is so fucking hard to do since I can't actually take off my rose-tinted glasses. They're like contact lenses that were in for so long that they fused with my eyeballs. 
<br><br>
Anywho, you're really putting me in a fix. I'll start out with the negatives maybe so it isn't the last thing you think about when you finish reading this.  Ok, so sometimes when you engage someone in a conversation you are so focused that you almost seem zoned out. (This is what may cause you to overlook subtle cues in body language while speaking to someone). It's particularly hard for me to reveal this to you because it's not something so significant that would need your attention but it's something that you should be aware of nonetheless so that you're a step ahead of your game.<br><br>
From an observers point of view, you tend to feel long pauses slightly uncomfortable and feel the need to communicate to fill those gaps as soon as possible. Now, while this method gets people like me in the zone to match your pace of communication, if it's just a regular joe who's meeting you for the first time it just seems like you're taking away their chance to speak, (or their desire to maintain intended silence.) This may happen when they need some time to think or if they feel like they can't match your level of communication and just start feeling inferior and insecure. So people usually give up and allow you to speak as they're discouraged to reciprocate. So, observing subtle changes in expressions will avoid it becoming simply a monologue.<br><br>

Now, lets come to my own impression of you when we used to interact initially. I don't really remember the first time I spoke to you, but the impression I had of you was: "Hey this is a fun person who isn't afraid to interact with people." I enjoyed speaking to you because you made me feel like I could be comfortable in my own skin and not worry about what I speak. You didn't seem to display the typical people-pleasing behavior that I have always found very off-putting in a person. Maybe that's why I respected you. Maybe that's why there are just a few people who appreciate you for being a "Real" person because not many people are drawn towards such people. I respected you because unlike most people, you thought about what you do instead of letting your impulses drive your life decisions.
Since then, you were on my list of people I'd like to understand and from whom I'd like to inherit valuable personality traits. So basically I wanted you to influence me. Your personality also reminded me a lot of Adrian :P knowing the two of you, I'd say you both have a lot of similar traits in terms of the way you deal with people and the way you think and make decisions. You both have a certain sense of clarity in thought that I lack. And eventually when I started contemplating if it was a good idea to think about the "what ifs" about dating you, that's what made me believe that I was way out of your league. A person with poor judgment and cloudy thoughts shouldn't deserve to date someone like Vanessa. I should settle in for less. Because to me, a relationship involves mutual influence and I was not convinced that I would be of any use to you. It would mostly be me seeking help from you to think clearly.  <br><br>
 Thinking about the prospect of a relationship back in January '17 forced me to think about why I should want to appreciate my own value. Because if I didn't, I'd really think I had nothing to offer and I would not be able to have the conviction to speak about how I felt.<br><br>
I put on my rose tinted glasses back on over there, I'm sorry. I'll try to recollect what I thought of you before that once again :P.
So, the only times I actually spent some time with you was during the unveiling of the car, and comic con so I'll have to think about the impression I had of you then. As I said earlier, I found you to be a cool person to hang out with and that was it (I didn't really give much thought to you actually). Since you were a guild member, I was eager to learn something from you because every guild member had these amazing skills and talents that I didn't have. I was impressed with your enthusiasm and knowledge about the car. You really took your shit seriously and didn't act like a complete airhead as I would expect you to be :P please don't punish me for expecting you to be a complete airhead Mein Führerin. I was so fucking wrong. After I got home, my mom was extra suspicious and strangely asked me what I was doing with a pair of a girl's pants so I innocently explained to her about what happened.... I was oblivious to how it looked, I'm only realizing it now lol. <br><br>
Now, coming back to comic con, I was a bit shaken when Nishad asked me if we dating and my first reaction was "Eww, no". :') (Please don't punish me Mein Führerin ;_;). You disregarded it immediately and so did I. I found the idea unacceptable because it felt like being accused of incest haha :P . Fortunately, it doesn't feel like that anymore huehuehuehue. It felt really inappropriate. It's like I couldn't even think about any real female from a romantic perspective without their consent or else my ego would start throwing a fit.<br><br>
However, there's something I noticed about you the first time I saw you that I'd rather reveal later; maybe in person.<br>
You were one of the people I'd like to stay in touch with for the rest of my life because it's hard to come across people of your caliber. I couldn't risk it with unpredictable emotional attachments now could I? I valued your friendship more than anything else so I was too afraid to risk it. I'd like to punch that side of me in the face, because I don't know what would have become of me if I didn't have a change of heart in January. I don't know what would have become of us. But whatever it was, I knew we'd still be the best of friends for the rest of our lives and that was an inevitable fate, regardless of the path we would take.
<br><br>I'm glad that you asked me what is love. And even gladder that I could show you.
